# MP Code 
Code Editor with Next.js, FastAPI, MongoDB, and ChatGPT Integration
MP Code is a powerful code editor that combines the best features of Next.js, FastAPI, MongoDB, and ChatGPT. It provides developers with a seamless coding experience, real-time code optimization, and an interactive chat-based assistant to help with code explanations and optimizations.

# Features
Code Editor: MP Code offers a feature-rich code editor powered by Next.js, a popular React framework. It provides a smooth and responsive coding environment with syntax highlighting, code completion, and other essential code editing capabilities.

# FastAPI Backend: 
The backend of MP Code is built with FastAPI, a high-performance web framework for Python. FastAPI ensures speedy request processing and facilitates seamless communication between the frontend and backend.

# Database Integration: 
MP Code utilizes MongoDB, a flexible NoSQL database, to store user profiles, code snippets, and other relevant data. MongoDB provides easy scalability and efficient data handling.

# ChatGPT Integration:
